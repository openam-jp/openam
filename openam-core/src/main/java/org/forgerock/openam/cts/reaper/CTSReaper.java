/**
 * Responsible for the scheduled deletion of expired Tokens.
 *
 * This implementation makes use of an LDAP specific concept of a paged query (that is,
 * one where results are returned in pages) which is performed against the persistent store
 * and the results are scheduled for deletion using the SDK provided asynchronous call.
 *
 * The LDAP SDK is responsible for managing the scheduling around asynchronous tasks and
 * as such simplifies the implementation to one that queries the results and delegates the
 * responsibility of deletion to the SDK.
 *
 * Once the search is complete, we need to wait for all asynchronous delete operations to
 * complete before we close the connection to the Directory. Otherwise we risk closing a
 * connection that has pending operations on it.
 *
 * This class is not responsible for scheduling and is expected to be scheduled according
 * to system configuration.
 *
 * Thread Policy: This runnable will respond to Thread interrupts and will exit cleanly
 * when interrupted.
